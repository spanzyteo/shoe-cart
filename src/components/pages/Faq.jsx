            Import duties are taxes collected on imports and some exports by a

            While the cost of shipment for your package is included in your

            We do everything on our end to declare customs (value, items,
            weight, material) to ensure that there is no added customs charge
            when your order arrives to your country. Most of our packages ship
            without any additional fees or charges, but each country has a
            unique customs process and occasionally random packages will be
            pulled for inspection. We cannot control if your order gets pulled
            and there are additional fees during the customs process in your
            country. We do our due diligence on our end to prevent this from
            happening, but unfortunately we are not in control of each order and
            it is up to your country's postal service how your order is handled.
            We recommend speaking with your local post office if you have any
            specific questions regarding your country's customs process.
